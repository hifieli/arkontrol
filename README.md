# arkontrol
A dedicated server manager for ARK: Survival Evolved

Just like the game itself, we are deep into Alpha phase testing, and far from finished.

arkontrol is composed of 2 main parts:

arkontrol-arkonboard - https://github.com/hifieli/arkontrol-arkonboard
  This is the installation script that installs ARK and Arkontrol
  
arkontrol-php - https://github.com/hifieli/arkontrol-php
  This is the web panel iteself


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Obtain a Cloud or Dedicated server with at least 3GB of RAM, and a fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Please see http://arkontrol.com for suggestions regarding where to find a server.
2. Log in to the system, issue these commands:
3. sudo wget http://cdn.arkontrol.com/arkontrol
4. sudo sh arkontrol

That's it! It will take about an hour to install everything, based on your network speed and how busy Steam's servers are at the time.
